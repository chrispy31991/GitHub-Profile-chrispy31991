# 🚀 Christian (Chris) Angerame
## AI & Reinforcement Learning Engineer | Systems Architect


I am a software developer dedicated to building autonomous systems that understand and navigate complex, high-stakes environments. My work sits at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning (RL), Market Psychology, and Agentic Workflows.

Currently, I am focused on evolving the Positioning Pressure Index (PPI)—a framework I engineered to quantify human behavioral extremes (exhaustion, stress, and sentiment) into structured data for machine learning agents.

# 🛠️ Core Focus & Research
Reinforcement Learning: Designing custom Gymnasium environments and training PPO/SAC agents for non-stationary market regimes.

Behavioral Modeling: Developing the Mirror Protocol to simulate cohort-based market reactions and Emotion Recognition Tags (ERT) for feature engineering.

Agentic Systems: Implementing RAG-driven LLM agents (Vertex AI/Gemini) to synthesize unstructured sentiment data into actionable alpha.

# 🔭 Current Projects
Sentient Trader RL: An end-to-end RL research platform utilizing PPI-weighted reward functions to train autonomous trading agents.

Positioning Pressure Index (PPI): A proprietary mathematical framework for scoring structural market fragility.

# 💻 Technical Stack
Languages: Python (PyTorch, Stable Baselines3, NumPy, Pandas), TypeScript/TSX, SQL.

AI/ML Tools: Vertex AI SDK, OpenAI API, Gymnasium, HuggingFace.

Infrastructure: MLOps pipelines, Docker, Git/GitHub Actions, CI/CD with Pre-commit.
